## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

I learnt that hover and focus are used to make interactive element more accessible.
when we say interactive elements we are trying to say an elemrnt that does something or go somewhere for eg: a button element will do something and anchor elment will open into a new content on a different page .
